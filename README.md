# Warning
This script creates a chart comparing pooled SMRs for "inclusion health" populations internationally (eg. people experiencing homelessness, people in prisons) to SMRs based on geographical deprivation in general population. However, these SMRs are not comparable because they have different comparison groups. The general population SMRs are all-age and therefore driven by deaths at older ages. In contrast, the "inclusion health" groups are mainly people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. It is likely that SMRs for deprivation groups in the general population when restricted to younger adults would look steeper.

To illustrate this, the repository also includes age-stratified SMRs, showing that the gradient appears steeper when limited to people aged 25-49.

There are other problems with the comparison of SMRs between the general population and "inclusion health" groups.
